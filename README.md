## 01-Circuit Theory Learning  
MPPT & equivalent resistance notes explains much of the fundamental theory behind switching DC-DC circuits that is common across buck, boost, and buck/boost topologies. The operation of each of these circuit topologies is also analysed individually.
  
My notes on the Circuit Theory relevant to this project can be found [here]
